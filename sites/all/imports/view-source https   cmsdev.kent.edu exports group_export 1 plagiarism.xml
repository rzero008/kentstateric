    <Title>Plagiarism</Title>
    <Body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Academic honesty is the academy&#039;s most cherished value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this university, we seek to find truth in all its forms whether scientific, artistic, or political. &amp;nbsp;It is our expectation that Kent State students and faculty uphold the highest level of integrity, and take personal responsibility for the work they produce. &amp;nbsp;In a digital age where music, photos, and thoughts and ideas are shared freely across the globe, it is sometimes harder for individuals to determine where the line is, and how not to cross it. &amp;nbsp; However, the fundamental principles of intellectual property remain constant and pureâ€”academic honesty is our highest responsibility. Simply put, Author Robert Fulghum said it well in his 1988 publication, All I Really Need To Know I Learned In Kindergarten, &quot;don&#039;t take things that aren&#039;t yours.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kent State&#039;s Committee on Plagiarism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
